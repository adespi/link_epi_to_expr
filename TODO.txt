TODO:
calculate average coefficient for each epigenome marks

smoothen correlation
PCA on expression, delete 5 first Components to delete confounding factors
only analyse coding genes, and if possible only TF
Correlate log of expression

plot density + interesting points with ggplot instead of R
standardise expression data (centrer reduire)
calculate correlation without cor() by matrix multiplication
show correlation for 1 point (expression=f(prediction))  forpatient(predictions$max_pred predictions$expression)
bcftools dosage (0,1,2) > eqtl, correlate genome with express

For each gene :
- Output seq/patient
- for each pos:
- run kipoi on batch size as big as can be (GPU cuda (this part most likely python))
- calculate correlations with matrix multiplication
