TODO:
calculate average coefficient for each epigenome marks

smoothen correlation
plot density + interesting points with ggplot instead of R
bcftools dosage (0,1,2) > eqtl, correlate genome with express


Label
Explain code
Empirical Bayes frd
Position/negative Corr, add std
Figures resolution
Graph variational auto encoder
Representation learning on networks
Statistical test to store only important positions and marks

DONE:
PCA on expression, delete 5 first Components to delete confounding factors ==> files already formated like this
only analyse coding genes, and if possible only TF ==> done list_genes
Correlate log of expression ==> files already formated like this
standardise expression data (centrer reduire) ==> files already formated like this
calculate correlation without cor() by matrix multiplication ==> use python instead of R achieves this
show correlation for 1 point (expression=f(prediction))  forpatient(predictions$max_pred predictions$expression) ==> jupyter notebook
run kipoi with python to run on bigger batches and not build the model all over again ==> new script python_prediction.py
run on GPU ==> recreate deepsea environement with --gpu tag, install nvidia drivers
